    Our Vision : “Light The Lamp of Education to End Poverty”

“We are the beginning to empower and transform lives through education”.
    Lamp Educational and Charitable Trust is a non-profit organization started in 2010 by Jaganathan Rajagopal in Bangalore.
    When he was working in a corporate company, often he was visiting NGOs, Old Age Homes, Cancer Hospitals, and Government Schools in Bangalore as part of CSR activities, after listening to many students’ painful stories, he volunteered to donate part of his salary and also collected donations from his friends to pay fees to the school and college dropout students. Later we started donating textbooks, notebooks, stationaries, uniforms, new & old dresses, and ration kits.</p>
    Our Mission is to educate 10,000 school and college dropout students and get jobs. To provide right education to underprivilege school & college students and get a right job. To enhance the promising of children, youth, and women by providing complete education through tutorials, schools, association, and communal programs
